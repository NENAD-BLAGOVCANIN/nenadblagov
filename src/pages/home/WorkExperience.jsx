                                In 2023 I created a startup called Multiverzum.com which is an eCommerce platform where
                                anyone can sign up and start shopping and selling products. The platform
                                also has many other features that allow shop owners to promote their products and even their
                                physical store. I developed the website using Python Django and the mobile
                                app with React Native.

                                cross-functional teams. For example, I was instrumental in developing a real-time chat

                                and implemented responsive, user-friendly websites that met the unique requirements of each

                                My responsibilities included understanding client needs, proposing technical solutions, and
                                delivering high-quality code within specified timelines. I honed my skills in
