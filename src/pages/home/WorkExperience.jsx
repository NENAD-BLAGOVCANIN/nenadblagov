                            In 2024 I worked as a full stack software developer for a company called Nexyo.ag and with their partners Beebucket.
                            I built their frontend application using ReactJS, and worked with ElasticSearch as our backend. I implemented searching functionality
                            and filtering functionalities on the project.

                            physical store. I developed the website using Python Django and the mobile
